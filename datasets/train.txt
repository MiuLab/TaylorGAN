What's up, guys?
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com.
A little winded already because I already did what you're going to do here in a second.
I actually did today's workout to prove a point that you can hit the best of both washboard Wednesday and Bodyweight Wednesday in one video for combined effect of actually training your abs, burning your fat in the process, and also helping to build muscle because we're going to create overload.
Remember, creating overload can come in any form and it doesn’t have to come in the form of weights.
Don’t deceive yourself to think that's the only way you can do it.
You can do it if you carefully select the exercise that you do to create overload.
So how are we going to do this?
You're going to do a push/pull leg combo and your rest period is going to be your direct ab training.
So indirectly you're going to hit your abs through the choice of exercise and then directly you're going to hit them during the rest period.
We start off here with a pushup.
It's a Spiderman pushup.
We're going to create indirect load on the abs, because of course, a pushup done in this position is already going to load your abs to keep your body off the ground.
We're going to make it more difficult, create the overload by decreasing the point of contacts that we have with the floor.
We basically have three points of contact with the same amount of your bodyweight having to be supported by the rest of your three limbs.
That's a bigger challenge.
If that's too easy for you then you can do too many reps.
Throw on a weight if you have the best opportunity to do that and now you've created additional overload.
Take it to failure and then go directly into your 45 second ab rest exercise.
In this case it's the pendulum plank.
